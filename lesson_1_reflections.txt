How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
By looking at the differences, you can see that there was some "spacr" which was probably meant to be "space"
note that 'r' and 'e' are just next to each other on the keyboard
using BeyondCompare for finding the differences between 2 files is much more convenient than plain "diff"

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
When debugging some problem, you can find in which version this bug appears first, then check the changes from
previous version may help you finding the change that caused the problem

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
There are only pros, I want to "calibrate" my commits by myself.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Multiple files in one commit is the way we work, I don't care about the other approach

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
find the relevant commit according to its comment, and diff with previous one

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
if there is a bug, you can easily localize the version in which it occured first by checking out previous versions

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
bla-bla-bla
